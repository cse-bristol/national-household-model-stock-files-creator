#'##Make and save waterheating data

#'Create a .csv file using the function make.waterheating, which creates a dataframe 
#'containing a complete set of populated variables for the water-heating.csv stock 
#'file.
#'
#'The water-heating.csv file contains a set of information on the hot water heating 
#'systems, including fuel type and efficencies. However, a significant majority of 
#'dwellings will have their hot water provide by their space heating systems (e.g. 
#'mains gas combi boilers or standard boilers with a water tank). In these instances,
#'much less information is required in the water-heating.csv and data that describes 
#'the efficiency or fuel used by the water heating system will be taken from the 
#'space heating system for that case.
#'
#'Otherwise the water heating data in 'Table 4a: Heating systems (space and water)' 
#'in the SAP 2012 documentation is used to allocate heating system types and 
#'efficiencies where a dwelling has separate space heating and water heating systems.
