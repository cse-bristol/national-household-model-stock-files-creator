#'The inconsistent values in the survey are preprocessed
#'
#'The values that are fixed are those that have an impact on stock creation,
#' the survey data has not been checked for complete consistancy, only those
#' variables that have been used;
#' i.e. an open fire fueled by electricity is not a physical
#' possibility and so assumptions have been made for this
#' case about what is likely to exist in order to create spaceheating
