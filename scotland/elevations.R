#'##Make and save elevations data

#'Create a .csv file using the function make.elevations, which creates a dataframe 
#'containing a complete set of populated variables for the elevations.csv stock 
#'file.
#'
#'The elevations file contains four rows for each dwelling case, one for each 
#'elevation of a dwelling (front, back, left and right). The information in the 
#'survey is used to determine which of these elevations are attached to party walls, 
#'the construction types of the unattached walls and levels of insulation on each 
#'elevation. Also included in data on types of window (glazing and frame type) and 
#'what proportion of each elevation is windows, and how many and the type of doors 
#'present in each elevation.
#'
#'Each elevation can have only one wall type and can only have full or no insulation 
#'but multiple types of insulation are allowed (i.e. an external wall on an elevation
#'could have both external and internal wall insulation present).
#'
#' Attachments and proportion of windows are expressed in tenths.

#' ##Wall construction and insulation

#' should be made out of the primary and secondary wall types
#'
#'The wall type information is stored across several values of the survey data, this
#' is combined where necessary to create a vector which is then mapped to possible
#' wall types for the NHM.
#' 
#' The stock data details two wall types: primary and secondary as well as providing 
#' information on the coverage (in tenths) of the primary wall. Where a secondary 
#' wall type exists, the function below determines the proportion of exposed walls to
#' allocate to the details (construction and insulation) described in the primary 
#' wall variables. The secondary wall details are then used to assign information to 
#' the remaining faces of each case/dwelling.
#' 
#' Any cavity construction type that is built with blockwork or brick is allocated as
#' a 'cavity' wall, which in the NHM covers all masonry cavities. Other cavity walls 
#' constructed of different materials are assigned accordingly and as shown below.
#' 
#' So to calculate the number of primary walls that should exist, the number of 
#' unattached walls is combined with the proportion of walls that are primary walls.
